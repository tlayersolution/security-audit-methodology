## 🛡️ Overview

At **Tlayersolution**, we don't just find bugs; we engineer defenses. This repository outlines the proprietary methodology we use to audit, secure, and harden high-performance systems built on **Node.js** and **Java (Spring Boot)**.

Our goal is to identify critical vulnerabilities before they become financial or reputational liabilities.

---

## 🛠️ Audit Methodology (The 4-Phase Cycle)

| Phase | Description | Tools Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01. Reconnaissance** | Subdomain discovery, tech stack fingerprinting, and attack surface mapping. | Nmap, Subfinder, Whois |
| **02. Dynamic Analysis (DAST)** | Real-time testing of active APIs and web interfaces for injections and bypasses. | Burp Suite Professional, OWASP ZAP |
| **03. Static Analysis (SAST)** | Deep-dive code review of **Java/Spring Boot** and **Node.js** codebases for logic flaws. | SonarQube, Manual Code Review |
| **04. Remediation** | Delivery of a technical report with specific code patches and hardening guides. | Git, Docker (Container Security) |

## 🔍 Key Assessment Areas

### 🔑 Authentication & Identity
- **JWT Hardening:** Testing for weak signatures, algorithm confusion, and lack of expiration.
- **OAuth/Auth0 Integrations:** Ensuring secure token exchange and scope validation.

### 🔌 API & Backend Security
- **Injection Prevention:** Mitigation of SQLi, NoSQLi, and Command Injections in **PostgreSQL** and **MongoDB** environments.
- **Rate Limiting:** Protecting resources against Brute Force and DoS attacks.
- **Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA):** Ensuring users only access their own data.

### 🐳 Infrastructure & Cloud
- **Docker Security:** Scanning for vulnerable base images and misconfigured container privileges.
- **Deployment Hardening:** Auditing **Vercel** and **Render** configurations for secure headers and SSL integrity.

## 📄 Sample Report (The Tlayer Standard)

Our clients receive more than just a list of errors. They receive a **Roadmap to Security**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **What our reports include:**
> 1. **Executive Summary:** Business risk explained for non-technical stakeholders.
> 2. **Technical Deep-Dive:** Step-by-step reproduction of the vulnerability.
> 3. **Remediation Code:** Production-ready code snippets (Java/Node.js) to fix the issue.
> 4. **Severity Scoring:** CVSS-based prioritization.
